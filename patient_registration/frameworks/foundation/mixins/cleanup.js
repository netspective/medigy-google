/**

  This view mixin disconnects bindings upon becoming invisible, and reconnects
  them upon becoming visible again.  At the same time, it fires setup() and
  cleanup() hook methods in case you want to override them and do additional
  setup or cleanup.
  
  This mixin is especially useful for dynamically created views with custom
  bindings and observers, like some of the more complicated collection/list item views that
  are created and destroyed dynamically and come and go often.  This mixin helps
  keep outdated bindings from accumulating in views that are not immediately
  in use.  (Without this fix, the bindings do still fire).
